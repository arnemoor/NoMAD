NoMAD

Get all of AD, with none of the bind!

NoMAD allows for all of the functionality you would want from a Mac bound to
Active Directory without having to actually bind to AD.

- NoMAD allows you to get Kerberos credentials from AD to use for single sign
on to all services using Windows Authentication. This is primarily web sites
and SMB/CIFS shares, but other services may be functional as well.
- Automatically renew your Kerberos tickets based upon your desires.
- Handy place to have a lock screen menu item.
- Get an X509 identity from your Windows CA.
- One click access to Casper self-service if installed.
- One click access to creating a Bomgar chat session with a help desk operative.
- Admins can push one-line CLI commands to show up as a menu item in NoMAD.
- Admins can specify specific LDAP servers to use instead of looking them up via SRV records.
- Synch your AD password to your local account.
- Users are warned about impending password exirations.
- Customize user's help options between a Bomgar URL, web URL or local application path.

Coming in future versions:

- VPN connection managament for built-in VPN types.
- Mounting of arbitrary shares based upon configured values.
- Put x509 certificate into an 802.1x profile for use with wireless networks.
