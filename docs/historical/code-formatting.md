In order to make code formatting consistent across the project, please use the following guidelines:

1. Leave Xcode's indentation settings at their default. (The settings are shown in the screenshot below.)
2. Before committing any file, select the entire contents with Command-A and then use the Xcode Re-Indent function with Control-I. (Also at **Editor > Structure > Re-Indent**)
3. Make sure there is exactly one, and only one, newline at the bottom of the file. (This will prevent compiler warnings from 1978 appearing about the lack of a newline at the end of the file. Such is the world we live in.)
