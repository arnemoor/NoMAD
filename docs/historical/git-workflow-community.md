We love help with the NoMAD project! Contributing is easy for GitLab members.

1. Check out our [Xcode Settings](Xcode-settings) and [Code Formatting](code-formatting) pages. Configure Xcode accordingly.
2. Fork the NoMAD repo to your account.
3. Make your changes against the Experimental branch.
4. When you are done, submit a merge request back to the Experimental branch of the main project.

Following a code review, your changes may be merged into the main project. Please be clear in your pull request what you have changed and keep each request isolated to a specific feature or issue that needs to be addressed.
